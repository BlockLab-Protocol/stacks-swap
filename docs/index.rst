Features
--------
catamaranswaps.org provides a web interface to two types of trustless swaps:

* :doc:`catamaran` between the bitcoin network and the stacks network.
* :doc:`atomic` between assets only on the stacks network.

Swaps can be canceled after 100 blocks.

Users are required to have the `Hiro Wallet web extension <https://hiro.so/wallet/install-web>`_ installed.

Find a Swapping Partner
-----------------------
The web application does not provide any tools to find a partner to swap assets,
nor does it help to determine a price.

Naming
------
Swaps between Bitcoin and Stacks are called *Catamaran Swaps* because
- unlike `Submarine Swap <https://wiki.ion.radar.tech/tech/research/submarine-swap>`_ -
the two parts happen on-chain/above water, just on two different chains.
